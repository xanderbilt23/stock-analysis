# Green Stocks Analysis Refactored

## Overview of Project

Purpose of this project was to analyze stock performance for 12 stock tickers and refactor the code to make the code more efficient.

## Results
In 2017, all stock tickers had a positive return except for TERP.

Based on the above screenshots it is concluded that the refactored code is more efficient. 

## Summary
Advantage of the refactored code is that the run time is much more efficient and can be used for any stock year moving forward. A disadvantage is that refactoring code can break the code to an existing already functioning code and takes a long time to refactor due to debugging.
